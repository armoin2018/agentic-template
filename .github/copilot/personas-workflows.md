# Persona Creation Workflows for GitHub Copilot

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Creating Your First Persona
```bash
# Activate persona creation mode
@personas /create backend-engineer microservices

# This will:
# - Generate a new persona file using the standard template
# - Customize for backend engineering with microservices focus
# - Include domain-specific tools, frameworks, and workflows
# - Provide initial quality scoring and enhancement suggestions
```

### 2. Optimizing Existing Personas
```bash
# Review and score an existing persona
@personas /score developer/backend-engineer.md

# Enhance specific aspects
@personas /enhance developer/backend-engineer.md workflows

# Modernize with current best practices
@personas /modernize developer/backend-engineer.md
```

### 3. Managing Persona Collections
```bash
# Generate comprehensive index
@personas /index common/personas/

# Compare persona capabilities
@personas /compare backend-engineer.md fullstack-developer.md

# Validate template compliance
@personas /validate developer/mobile-developer.md
```
