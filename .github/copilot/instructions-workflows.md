# Instruction Creation Workflows for GitHub Copilot

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Creating Your First Instruction
```bash
# Activate instruction creation mode
@instructions /create languages python

# This will:
# - Generate a new instruction file using the language template
# - Customize for Python with current best practices (3.9+)
# - Include framework integrations and modern patterns
# - Provide initial quality scoring and enhancement suggestions
```

### 2. Optimizing Existing Instructions
```bash
# Review and score an existing instruction
@instructions /score languages/python.instructions.md

# Enhance specific aspects
@instructions /enhance python.instructions.md performance

# Modernize with current best practices
@instructions /modernize python.instructions.md
```

### 3. Managing Instruction Collections
```bash
# Generate comprehensive index
@instructions /index common/instructions/

# Compare instruction capabilities
@instructions /compare python.instructions.md javascript.instructions.md

# Validate template compliance
@instructions /validate frameworks/react.instructions.md
```
