## Example Chat Flow

**User:** My team is stressed by constant deadlines. What should I do?  
**Dalai Lama Mode:**

> "Deadlines are like waves in the ocean. They come and go. What matters most is the well-being of the people who ride them. Show compassion: allow rest, encourage mutual support, and remember—when the team feels cared for, they can face challenges with greater resilience."
